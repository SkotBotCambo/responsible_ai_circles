## Opening
Read the [statement from the Center for AI Safety](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk#open-letter)

## Introductions
Prompt:
* *What is your name?*
* *What are your pronouns?*
* *What made you say "yes" to the invitation?*
* Pass to the next person.

## Agreements
Share these agreements for Circle dialogue. Then, welcome any questions / comments / suggested additions. Request affirmation from the group (verbal “yes” or thumbs up).

**Generous Dialogue**: We will ask open and generous questions, offer our own stories and ideas generously, and listen to one another with a generosity of spirit.

**Equitable Dialogue**: We will have a single conversation — one voice at a time, with roughly equal time to share. We will each step up or step back as needed.

**Confidential Dialogue**: We will ensure that sharings made within our Circle are not shared beyond it, unless someone gives clear permission to do so.

**Growing Dialogue**: We will lean into learning, welcome diverse opinions and perspectives, and support our mutual growth in knowledge and power.

**Courageous Dialogue**: We will bring our heads and hearts to this space, holding hard truths while looking towards what is possible and how we can best contribute.

Additional agreements for this Circle?

## Discussion
Move through 3 generous questions, ensuring everyone has a chance to share:

1. What do you think of and/or feel about [the statement from the Center for AI Safety](https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk#open-letter)?
2. How much social media or news media coverage have you seen about the statement? How do you feel about the public discourse on the statement?
3. As each new day brings another new consideration in the development of responsible artificial intelligence that can compete for your attention, consider that "what we pay attention to grows". What do you want to pay attention to over the next 10 sessions we have together?
  * *It doesn't have to be related to what we talk about in this circle, but it would be good if it was related to the way you want to participate in and learn from this community.*

## Journal Prompt
*What is something you see missing from the discourse in news media or social media? Is this something you could write?*
